I've created a simple HTML file that displays the issue information. The file includes:

- A clear title showing "Implement Binance Klines fetching"
- The issue body describing the requirements to fetch BTC/USDT Kline data from Binance API
- Selection options for different time intervals (1m, 5m, 1h)
- Professional styling with a clean layout
- Additional sections for technical requirements and tags

The HTML file is saved at `/home/runner/work/x-agent/x-agent/issue.html` and can be opened in any web browser to view the issue details.
